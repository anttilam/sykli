# What is this project
This project is created for the needs of my current internship. It functions as a questionnaire. User logs in via google account, answers to forms and the results are sent and stored to a cloud database (google firebase). The site is hosted there as well. Thought out to be customizable, so it can be re-used as easily as possible. 

# Project structure
Even though this is a relatively small app, it is built as a proper long term project would be. With typescript, folder structure, barreling and as much re-usability as possible. 

# TODO:
- embedded powerBI charts based on results
- AI prompt

# IMPROVEMENTS
- one question at a time, side scroller(?)
- form validator
